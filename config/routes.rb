  # routes notes:
  # formats:
  # root 
  # regular route format is get '<pageName>' => '<controller>#<function>'
  # get '<THIS PART>' is incidentally the name of the link usually (e.g. in html.erb) this is the link_to "<Text that user sees>", <THIS PART>_path
  # this is also (probably) the name of the method found @ the controller 
  # finally, you can give these custom names if you wish to be pointed at easier (as: part)
